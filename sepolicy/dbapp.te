# DbApp - 3rd party app with untrusted_app domain
# Using default untrusted_app domain for realistic 3rd party app simulation

# If UDS connection is used, untrusted_app needs permissions to connect to vendor daemon
# This may be blocked by AOSP neverallow rules - to be tested

# Note: Starting with default untrusted_app domain with no additional permissions
# If connection fails, we may need to add specific permissions or use alternative approach
